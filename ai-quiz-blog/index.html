    <h1>Using Generative AI to Build an Interactive Web 2.0 Element: A Quiz App on Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Disclaimer:</h2>
      <p>This article and the multimedia element described within have been partially or fully generated and developed with the assistance of Generative AI tools, including ChatGPT-4o (OpenAI), GitHub Copilot, and Cursor AI. All content has been reviewed, edited, and verified by the author to ensure accuracy and compliance with academic standards. Sources generated or suggested by AI have been independently checked and cited in APA format.</p>

      <h2>📌 Context and Objective</h2>
      <p>As part of the exam activity, the goal was to use Generative AI (GAI) to create a multimedia interactive app—a single-function, interactive element such as an application, animation, or webpage.</p>
      <p>I chose to build a web-based interactive quiz app on the topic of Artificial Intelligence in everyday life. This small project highlights how GAI tools can assist not only in generating code, but also in shaping content, design, functionality, and user interaction.</p>

      <h2>🧠 Tools and Technologies Used</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ChatGPT-4o (OpenAI)</strong> – used for generating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, UI/UX suggestions, and debugging logic;</li>
        <li><strong>GitHub Copilot</strong> – code completion, error handling, syntax suggestions;</li>
        <li><strong>Cursor AI</strong> – debugging support, code improvement in VS Code;</li>
        <li><strong>Figma</strong> – initial UI prototyping;</li>
        <li><strong>Images</strong> – sourced from personal screenshots and FlatIcon for icons (human-made media included as required).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>🎯 Why This Topic?</h2>
      <p>I chose the theme “What do you know about AI?” because:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It’s relevant and widely discussed;</li>
        <li>It mixes educational content with interactive experience;</li>
        <li>It’s perfect to demonstrate how GAI can be used to generate content (quiz questions and logic) along with layout and visual design.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🔧 Development Process</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Concept Definition</strong>
          <p>I started with a clear idea: a basic quiz with 3–5 questions about artificial intelligence. Initial prompt to ChatGPT-4o:</p>
          <pre><code>“Create a simple HTML/CSS/JS quiz app with 5 questions about artificial intelligence. Add a score at the end. Responsive and minimal UI.”</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Code Generation</strong>
          <p>ChatGPT-4o generated a full HTML page with embedded CSS and JavaScript for quiz logic. I verified and corrected the output using GitHub Copilot and Cursor AI inside VS Code.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Adding Interactivity</strong>
          <p>The app includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Multiple-choice answers;</li>
            <li>Real-time answer tracking;</li>
            <li>A final result score with a personalized message;</li>
            <li>A restart quiz button.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Prompt used:</p>
          <pre><code>“Add score tracking and final result display in a modal with a restart button. Keep it mobile friendly.”</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Design and Media Integration</strong>
          <p>I included a header banner (sourced manually) and applied a clean, mobile-responsive layout using Flexbox. Visual elements are all either personal or openly licensed (e.g., FlatIcon), in line with the “human-made” media requirement.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Testing and Refinement</strong>
          <p>Using Cursor AI, I refined layout behavior on mobile screens, improved accessibility, and optimized the code logic.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>🆚 Difference from January’s App</h2>
      <p>The previous project (January) was a static image carousel with basic JS logic;</p>
      <p>This project has:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Full interactive logic, including score computation;</li>
        <li>Dynamic user feedback;</li>
        <li>Topic-focused educational content;</li>
        <li>Use of multiple AI tools (not just one).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🔍 Key Prompts Used</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>“Create a minimal interactive AI quiz with HTML/CSS/JS. 5 questions, multiple choice.”</li>
        <li>“Add a restart button and dynamic feedback at the end of the quiz.”</li>
        <li>“Optimize the layout for mobile devices using CSS flexbox.”</li>
        <li>“Can you rewrite this function to include error checking?”</li>
        <li>“Explain this part of the code to me – what does this JS function do?”</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>✍️ Final Reflection</h2>
      <p>This activity demonstrated how GAI can significantly speed up and enhance app development. From idea to deployment, tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, and Cursor provided support in logic, structure, content, and responsiveness.</p>
      <p>One key insight: the quality of the prompt determines the relevance and usability of the generated output. Also, all AI-generated content must be verified and adapted to ensure accuracy and usability.</p>
